# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The client here is DriverPass.  After observing the unacceptable number of students who fail the driving test for the DMV, the client had asked us to build
  a system that will allow users to access their training material and schedule driving lessons with the instructors to better assist them in passing the driving     test.


What did you do particularly well?

  I believe the communication was the biggest part of our success with this project.  We collected and understood the true intent of the client and communicated
  well within the Scrum team to ensure that all requirements were met within each sprint and for the final product.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I beleive the one part of these documents that I would revise would be my UML activity diagrams.  While I am confident that they explain the activity fully,
  I feel I could have a bit more details on how the activity was to be executed.  For example, 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The interview transcripts were the crucial part in helping me to interpret and implement the needs of the users.  For each instance that I believe could be 
  Implemented, I made a use case for.  For me, use cases hold the most value for what is needed for the client and for the users.  They allow you to sit in the 
  shoes of the users and see what they would, allowing for a better understanding of what is to be needed to ensure a smooth and complete operational system.
  When designing, the users needs are of the utmost importance due to the fact that they are the entire reason you are building the system.  If the users needs
  are not considered when designing a product, you will ultimately have a product that can not or will not be used for a number of reasons.  If the system does 
  not include what the user seeks to accomplish or is too difficult for the users to navigate or understand, sometimes, they simply will not use it.  This results
  in a failed product.  The user needs should always be a priority.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  The first steps I will take when designing software is collecting all of the information possible.  It is important that I know and understand not only what 
  the client wants, but what they are trying to accomplish with the product.  From this I can create use cases to understand what the user needs so that it
  works cooperatively with the requirements provided by the client.  From these I would begin to create diagrams starting with the use cases, then on to the           activity and sequence diagrams.  I believe all of these techniques will provide the Scrum team with the information needed to properly communicate amongst one       another and to create a successful product.
